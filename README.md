# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to understanding and documenting the process of **requirement analysis** in software development.  

Requirement analysis is one of the most important phases in the software development life cycle (SDLC). Its purpose is to gather, analyze, and clearly define the needs of users and stakeholders before the actual design and coding begin.  

The materials in this repo will help explain:
- Why requirement analysis is critical for building successful projects.  
- Different types of requirements (functional, non-functional, business).  
- Methods and tools used to capture and validate requirements.  

This project serves as a resource for learning, practice, and reference in both academic and real-world development contexts.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining the needs and expectations of users, stakeholders, and the system itself before building a software product. It ensures that everyone involved in the project has a clear understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.  

In simple terms, it answers the question: **“What problem are we solving, and what exactly should the software do to solve it?”**

### Why It’s Important in SDLC
Requirement analysis is a critical phase in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** because:
- It provides a **clear foundation** for design and development.  
- It helps avoid misunderstandings and costly rework later in the project.  
- It aligns developers, stakeholders, and users on the same vision.  
- It ensures both **functional requirements** (what the system should do) and **non-functional requirements** (performance, security, usability, etc.) are well defined.  
- It improves project success rates by reducing risks and ambiguities.  

Without proper requirement analysis, software projects often suffer from **scope creep, delays, and user dissatisfaction.** By investing time in this phase, teams save effort in the long run and deliver products that truly meet user needs.
