# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to understanding and documenting the process of **requirement analysis** in software development.  

Requirement analysis is one of the most important phases in the software development life cycle (SDLC). Its purpose is to gather, analyze, and clearly define the needs of users and stakeholders before the actual design and coding begin.  

The materials in this repo will help explain:
- Why requirement analysis is critical for building successful projects.  
- Different types of requirements (functional, non-functional, business).  
- Methods and tools used to capture and validate requirements.  

This project serves as a resource for learning, practice, and reference in both academic and real-world development contexts.
